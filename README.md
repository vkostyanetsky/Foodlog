This script calculates approximate number of calories, proteins, fats & carbohydrates which I consume during a day. 

Of course, I'm aware that there are countless tools to solve the task, on smartphones especially. Furthermore, I've tried to use many of them, but gave up eventually. Some of them lose my data without a reason, some have terrible UI, and almost each one dreams of selling me a paid subscription. Gosh, I just need one simple function!

So I decide:

![Fine, I'll do it myself](https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/FoodDiary/raw/main/tanos.png)

## ‚ò∫ Installation

```
pip install foodlog 
```

## ü§î How to use it? 

There are two YAML files: `catalog.yaml` which contains food you used to consume and `journal.yaml` which contains products you have eaten.

Let's imagine that today is March 27, and you have eaten two apples for a lunch. If it's first time you eat an apple, you open catalog.yaml and write something like:  

```yaml
apple: 
  calories: 54
  protein:  0.4
  fat:      0.4
  carbs:    9.8
```

Then you open journal.yaml and write the name of food you just added to the catalog and its weights in grams:

```yaml
2022-04-27:

- apple: 114
- apple: 129
```

First line here is a current date in the YYYY-MM-DD format. The journal may consist of many of them. For example:

```yaml
2022-04-26:
  
- apple: 120  
- bread: 403
- pizza: 356

2022-04-27:

- apple: 114
- apple: 129
```

Having catalog & journal both filled, it's possible to see how many calories and macronutrients you've consumed. If your files in C:\FoodDiary, run this:

```
foodlog
```

For instance, script output may look like this:

```

You can find all configurable parameters of the script (calories limit, target ranges of macronutrients etc.) in the `profile.yaml` file.
